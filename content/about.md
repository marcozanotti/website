Hi, I am Marco from Italy.  
I am an R Developer and I am very passionate about learning and education.  
I speak Italian, English and a little bit of French.

Here you can have a look at my [Curriculum
Vitae](https://marcozanotti.github.io/CVitae/).  


## Professional Experience

I am a **Data Scientist** with **7 years** working experience.

I started to work as Junior Data Scientist in 2017, in an Italian
multinational tourism company, [Uvet Global Business Travel](https://www.uvetgbt.com/), and its airline company [Blue Panorama](https://www.blue-panorama.com/it). 
There, I learnt a ton of things related to **R** and I had the opportunity 
to work with lot of different data related to business travel, pharmaceutical events, online bookings, hotels' reservations, and proprietary airline data.

In 2020, I started to work as a Data Scientist for T-Voice, a start-up
company of the [Triboo Group](https://triboo.com/). There I
worked as a Senior Consultant to develop **client specific data analysis
solutions**.

Since 2021, following an M&A operation, I am working as a **Senior Data
Scientist and R Developer** in [Blogmeter](https://www.blogmeter.it/it/home), 
an Italian Social Network Monitoring company.

Moreover, since 2022 I am a **PhD Researcher in Statistics** at the University
of Milano Bicocca.

The first project, on which I was involved during the years, was related
to the development of an **Optical Character Recognition pipeline**
allowing to automate several business processes (fines automatic reader,
HR documents automatic compiler, and others). In that occasion I
developed my first (business) **R package** and I learnt how to
effectively work and manage a **Unix RStudio Server**, which I was also
responsible for.

During the years, I performed **opinion mining** analyses through supervised
and unsupervised machine learning methods. In particular, I managed the
company's text analysis platform. Then, I was the **supervisor of the
front-end and back-end activities** on the same platform.
Now, I am the **coordinator of R&D activities** to improve both customer and
platform solutions.

Finally, throughout all my working experience I was responsible for the
development of **time series forecasting** models, both for internal and
clients needs. Since 2021 I am working on the development of a 
**high-performance forecasting system** that allows to quickly produce 
forecasts for thousands time series using many different approaches and 
algorithms.


## Teaching Experience

Since 2019 I am **Adjunct Professor** at the University of Milan. 
I teach Statistics and Mathematical Methods in few Bachelor's degree 
courses, and Time Series Forecasting, Statistical Learning and R Coding
at the Master's degree in [Data Science](https://dse.cdl.unimi.it/en).  
Have a look at my [teachings](https://marcozanotti.netlify.app/teachings/).  

Moreover, during these years, I had also the opportunity to
have lectures in other major Italian Universities, always related to
**Statistics & Data Science**.  

Since 2019 I am also teaching R Programming to business
experts and I am studying to become an 
[RStudio Certified R Trainer](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/).  

I really like teaching, indeed, since 2018 I have helped **more than 200
students** with their exams, thesis and PhD projects, through **private
lectures** and support. I mainly teach econometrics, time series,
forecasting, R programming, statistics and data science related
topics.  
I am ranked the first on [Superprof](https://www.superprof.it/) Italia
for [**Econometrics &
Forecasting**](https://www.superprof.it/lezioni-econometria-time-series-forecasting-gretl-piu-anni-esperienza-analisi-dati-laureato-magistrale.html),
and on the same platform I also offer lectures on [**Statistics &
Mathematics**](https://www.superprof.it/lezioni-matematica-statistica-piu-anni-esperienza-analisi-dati-laureato-magistrale-finanza-quantitativa.html),
and [**Data Science & R
Programming**](https://www.superprof.it/lezioni-data-science-machine-learning-programmazione-piu-anni-esperienza-analisi-dati-laureato-magistrale.html).


## Publications

In 2021 I created my first public available R package.

[Lorenzo Mazzucchelli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzo-mazzucchelli-72a661122/)
and I worked for a year on various analysis related to the topic of
**behavioral finance** and we noticed that no packages were available on
CRAN to perform such kind of researches. Hence, we decided to develop
the first R package allowing R users to perform several types of
behavioral analysis.

The released version of the
[**dispositionEffect**](https://marcozanotti.github.io/dispositionEffect)
package is available on
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dispositionEffect).  
The software has been presented at the 
[useR!2021 Conference](https://user2021.r-project.org/) 
and it has been listed on the 
[Top 40 New CRAN Packaes](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2021/09/27/august-2021-top-40-new-cran-packages/)
on August 2021.

Furthermore, together with Lorenzo, I am going to publish in 2022 two
**scientific researches** related to the disposition effect on financial
markets.  


## Education

I studied in Italy and Finland, where I lived for six months and I had
amazing experiences.

&nbsp;

I graduated **cum laude** in a **Master's degree in Quantitative Finance** 
at the University of Milan, with a thesis related to time series forecasting.

In 2018, while working, I got a second level **Master in Data Science**.

Since 2022, I am a **PhD Researcher of Statistics** at the University of Milano 
Bicocca. 

I like studying, indeed, during the last five years I got many certifications 
related to Data Science & Forecasting. I am now studying Python to improve my 
programming skills and I got few certifications on the Google Cloud Platform.


## Sports & Hobbies

I was a **footballer**. I played in Italian minor championships until
22. I also like reading manga, playing board games, curling and
footgolf.

Since 2020, I practice **kite surf**, an amazing water-board sport, and 
whenever I can I go kite surfing all around the world.
