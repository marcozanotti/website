Hi, I am Marco from Italy. I am an R Developer and I am very passionate about 
learning and education.  
I speak Italian, English and a little bit of French. 

Here you can have a look at my [Curriculum Vitae](/pagedown-html/cv.html) or,
if you prefer, download a printable version [here](/pagedown-pdf/cv.pdf).  


## Professional Experience

I am a **Data Scientist** with 5 years working experience.    

I started to work as Junior Data Scientist in 2017, in an Italian multinational
tourism company, 
[Uvet Global Business Travel](https://www.uvetgbt.com/), and its airline
company [Blue Panorama](https://www.blue-panorama.com/it).
There, I learnt a ton of things related to **R** and I had the opportunity to work 
with lot of different data related to
business travel, pharmaceutical events, online bookings, hotels' reservations,
and proprietary airline data.  

From 2020, I am working as a Data Scientist for 
[T-Voice](https://www.triboo-voice.com/), a start-up company of the 
[Triboo Group](https://triboo.com/), a digital transformation factory quoted 
on the Italian Stock Exchange. Here, I work as a Senior Consultant to develop
**client specific data analysis solutions**.

The first project, on which I was involved during the years, was related to 
the development of an **Optical Character Recognition pipeline** allowing to 
automate several business processes (fines automatic reader, HR documents 
automatic compiler, and others). In that occasion I developed my first 
(business) **R package** and I learnt how to effectively work and manage a 
**Linux RStudio Server**, which I was also responsible for.  

Meanwhile, I performed **opinion mining** analyses through supervised and unsupervised 
machine learning methods. In particular, I managed the company's text analysis
platform. Now, I am the **supervisor of the front-end and back-end activities** on 
the same platform, and I **coordinate statistical R&D activities** to improve the
platform solutions.  

Finally, throughout all my working experience I was responsible for the development
of **time series forecasting** models, both for internal and clients needs. Since
2020 I am working on developing **high-performance forecasting system** that allows 
to quickly produce forecasts for thousands time series using many different
approaches and algorithms.  


## Teaching Experience



## Publications

In 2021 I created my first public available R package.  

Lorenzo Mazzucchelli and I worked for a year on various analysis related to 
the topic of **behavioural finance** and we noticed that no packages were available
on CRAN to perform such kind of researches. Hence, we decided to develop the 
first R package allowing R users to perform several types of behavioural analysis.  

The development version of the
**[dispositionEffect](https://marcozanotti.github.io/dispositionEffect)** package is
already fully available on [Github](https://github.com/marcozanotti/dispositionEffect).   
Soon, we will present it at [useR!2021](https://user2021.r-project.org/) and we 
will proceed to CRAN submission.

Furthermore, together with Lorenzo, I will publish soon also a **scientific research**
related to the disposition effect on financial markets.  

## Education

I studied in Italy and Finland, where I lived for six months and I had amazing 
experiences.

I graduated cum laude in a Master's degree in Quantitative Finance, with a
thesis related to time series forecasting.  

In 2018, while working, I got a second level Master in Data Science.  


## Sports & Hobbies

I was a **footballer**. I played in Italian minor championships until 22. I also 
like reading manga, playing boadgames, curling and footgolf.  

Since 2020, I practice **kitesurf**, and amazing water board sport.
