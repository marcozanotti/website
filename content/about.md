Hi, I am Marco from Italy. I am an R Developer and I am very passionate about 
learning and education.  
I speak Italian, English and a little bit of French. 

Here you can have a look at my [Curriculum Vitae](/pagedown-html/cv.html) or,
if you prefer, download a printable version [here](/pagedown-pdf/cv.pdf).  


## Professional Experience

I am a **Data Scientist** with 5 years working experience.    

I started to work as Junior Data Scientist in 2017, in an Italian multinational
tourism company, 
[Uvet Global Business Travel](https://www.uvetgbt.com/), and its airline
company [Blue Panorama](https://www.blue-panorama.com/it).
There, I learnt a ton of things related to **R** and I had the opportunity to work 
with lot of different data related to business travel, pharmaceutical events,
online bookings, hotels' reservations, and proprietary airline data.  

From 2020, I am working as a Data Scientist for 
[T-Voice](https://www.triboo-voice.com/), a start-up company of the 
[Triboo Group](https://triboo.com/), a digital transformation factory quoted 
on the Italian Stock Exchange. Here, I work as a Senior Consultant to develop
**client specific data analysis solutions**.

The first project, on which I was involved during the years, was related to 
the development of an **Optical Character Recognition pipeline** allowing to 
automate several business processes (fines automatic reader, HR documents 
automatic compiler, and others). In that occasion I developed my first 
(business) **R package** and I learnt how to effectively work and manage a 
**Linux RStudio Server**, which I was also responsible for.  

Meanwhile, I performed **opinion mining** analyses through supervised and unsupervised 
machine learning methods. In particular, I managed the company's text analysis
platform. Now, I am the **supervisor of the front-end and back-end activities** on 
the same platform, and I **coordinate statistical R&D activities** to improve the
platform solutions.  

Finally, throughout all my working experience I was responsible for the development
of **time series forecasting** models, both for internal and clients needs. Since
2020 I am working on developing **high-performance forecasting system** that allows 
to quickly produce forecasts for thousands time series using many different
approaches and algorithms.  


## Teaching Experience

In 2019 began my collaboration with the University of Milan. I teach statistics
in a Bachelor's degree course.  

From the very first experience as a TA, I had also the opportunity to have lectures
in other major Italian Universities, always related to **Statistics & Data Science**.   

In 2022 I will be the **Professor of [Time Series Forecasting]()** for the Master's degree
in [Data Science for Economics](https://www.unimi.it/it/corsi/corsi-di-laurea/data-science-and-economics-dse) 
in Milan.  

I really like teaching, indeed, since 2018 I have helped **more than 100 students** 
with their exams, thesis and Phd projects, through **private lectures** and support. 
I mainly teach econometrics, time series, forecasting, R programming, and data science.  
I am ranked the first on [Superprof](https://www.superprof.it/) Italia for 
**[Econometrics & Forecasting](https://www.superprof.it/lezioni-econometria-time-series-forecasting-gretl-piu-anni-esperienza-analisi-dati-laureato-magistrale.html)**, and on the same platform I also offer lectures on
**[Statistics & Mathematics](https://www.superprof.it/lezioni-matematica-statistica-piu-anni-esperienza-analisi-dati-laureato-magistrale-finanza-quantitativa.html)**, and 
**[Data Science & R Programming](https://www.superprof.it/lezioni-data-science-machine-learning-programmazione-piu-anni-esperienza-analisi-dati-laureato-magistrale.html)**.   

Moreover, in 2019 I also taught R Programming to business experts of Uvet GBT,
and I am now studying to become an 
[RStudio Certified R Trainer](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/).  


## Publications

In 2021 I created my first public available R package.  

[Lorenzo Mazzucchelli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzo-mazzucchelli-72a661122/) 
and I worked for a year on various analysis related to the topic of 
**behavioural finance** and we noticed that no packages were available
on CRAN to perform such kind of researches. Hence, we decided to develop the 
first R package allowing R users to perform several types of behavioural analysis.  

The development version of the
**[dispositionEffect](https://marcozanotti.github.io/dispositionEffect)** package is
already fully available on [Github](https://github.com/marcozanotti/dispositionEffect).   
Soon, we will present it at [useR!2021](https://user2021.r-project.org/) and we 
will proceed to CRAN submission.

Furthermore, together with Lorenzo, I will publish soon also a **scientific research**
related to the disposition effect on financial markets.  

## Education

I studied in Italy and Finland, where I lived for six months and I had amazing 
experiences.

&nbsp;  

I graduated **cum laude** in a **Master's degree in Quantitative Finance** at
the University of Milan, with a thesis related to time series forecasting.  

In 2018, while working, I got a second level **Master in Data Science**.    

I like studying, indeed, during the last five years I got many certifications
related to Data Science & Forecasting. 
I am now studying Python to improve programming skills, and I will soon enrol 
into a Google Cloud Platform Certification programme.


## Sports & Hobbies

I was a **footballer**. I played in Italian minor championships until 22. I also 
like reading manga, playing boardgames, curling and footgolf.  

Since 2020, I practice **kitesurf**, an amazing water-board sport.
