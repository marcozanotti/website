Hi, I am Marco from Italy.  
I am an R Developer and I am very passionate about learning and
education.  
I speak Italian, English and a little bit of French.

Here you can have a look at my [Curriculum
Vitae](https://marcozanotti.github.io/CVitae/cv_resume/cv_en.html)
(or download a [pdf
version](https://marcozanotti.github.io/CVitae/cv_resume/cv_en.pdf)).


## Professional Experience

I am a **Data Scientist** with 5 years working experience.

I started to work as Junior Data Scientist in 2017, in an Italian
multinational tourism company, [Uvet Global Business
Travel](https://www.uvetgbt.com/), and its airline company [Blue
Panorama](https://www.blue-panorama.com/it). There, I learnt a ton of
things related to **R** and I had the opportunity to work with lot of
different data related to business travel, pharmaceutical events, online
bookings, hotels' reservations, and proprietary airline data.

In 2020, I started to work as a Data Scientist for T-Voice, a start-up
company of the [Triboo Group](https://triboo.com/), a digital
transformation factory quoted on the Italian Stock Exchange. Here, I
work as a Senior Consultant to develop **client specific data analysis
solutions**.

Since 2021, following an M&A operation, I am working as a **Senior Data
Scientist and R Developer** in
[Blogmeter](https://www.blogmeter.it/it/home), an Italian Social
Monitoring company.

The first project, on which I was involved during the years, was related
to the development of an **Optical Character Recognition pipeline**
allowing to automate several business processes (fines automatic reader,
HR documents automatic compiler, and others). In that occasion I
developed my first (business) **R package** and I learnt how to
effectively work and manage a **Unix RStudio Server**, which I was also
responsible for.

Meanwhile, I performed **opinion mining** analyses through supervised
and unsupervised machine learning methods. In particular, I managed the
company's text analysis platform. Now, I am the **supervisor of the
front-end and back-end activities** on the same platform, and I
**coordinate statistical R&D activities** to improve the platform
solutions.

Finally, throughout all my working experience I was responsible for the
development of **time series forecasting** models, both for internal and
clients needs. Since 2021 I am working on the development of a 
**high-performance forecasting system** that allows to quickly produce 
forecasts for thousands time series using many different approaches and 
algorithms.


## Teaching Experience

In 2019 began my collaboration with the University of Milan, since then
I am teaching statistics in few Bachelor's degree courses.

From the very first experience as a TA, I had also the opportunity to
have lectures in other major Italian Universities, always related to
**Statistics & Data Science**.

In 2022 I will be the 
**Professor of 
[Time Series Forecasting](https://marcozanotti.github.io/tsforecasting-course/general-infos/tsf_description.html) 
& R** at
the Master's degree in 
[Data Science for Economics](https://www.unimi.it/it/corsi/corsi-di-laurea/data-science-and-economics-dse)
in Milan.

I really like teaching, indeed, since 2018 I have helped **more than 150
students** with their exams, thesis and PhD projects, through **private
lectures** and support. I mainly teach econometrics, time series,
forecasting, R programming, statistics and data science related
topics.  
I am ranked the first on [Superprof](https://www.superprof.it/) Italia
for [**Econometrics &
Forecasting**](https://www.superprof.it/lezioni-econometria-time-series-forecasting-gretl-piu-anni-esperienza-analisi-dati-laureato-magistrale.html),
and on the same platform I also offer lectures on [**Statistics &
Mathematics**](https://www.superprof.it/lezioni-matematica-statistica-piu-anni-esperienza-analisi-dati-laureato-magistrale-finanza-quantitativa.html),
and [**Data Science & R
Programming**](https://www.superprof.it/lezioni-data-science-machine-learning-programmazione-piu-anni-esperienza-analisi-dati-laureato-magistrale.html).

Moreover, since 2019 I am also teaching R Programming to business
experts in Uvet GBT and others. I am now studying to become an 
[RStudio Certified R Trainer](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/).


## Publications

In 2021 I created my first public available R package.

[Lorenzo Mazzucchelli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzo-mazzucchelli-72a661122/)
and I worked for a year on various analysis related to the topic of
**behavioral finance** and we noticed that no packages were available on
CRAN to perform such kind of researches. Hence, we decided to develop
the first R package allowing R users to perform several types of
behavioral analysis.

The released version of the
[**dispositionEffect**](https://marcozanotti.github.io/dispositionEffect)
package is available on
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dispositionEffect).  
The software has been presented at the 
[useR!2021 Conference](https://user2021.r-project.org/) 
and it has been listed on the 
[Top 40 New CRAN Packaes](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2021/09/27/august-2021-top-40-new-cran-packages/)
on August 2021.

Furthermore, together with Lorenzo, I am going to publish in 2022 two
**scientific research** related to the disposition effect on financial
markets.


## Education

I studied in Italy and Finland, where I lived for six months and I had
amazing experiences.

&nbsp;

I graduated **cum laude** in a **Master's degree in Quantitative Finance** 
at the University of Milan, with a thesis related to time series forecasting.

In 2018, while working, I got a second level **Master in Data Science**.

I like studying, indeed, during the last five years I got many
certifications related to Data Science & Forecasting. 
I am now studying Python to improve my programming skills and I got few 
certifications on the Google Cloud Platform.


## Sports & Hobbies

I was a **footballer**. I played in Italian minor championships until
22. I also like reading manga, playing board games, curling and
footgolf.

Since 2020, I practice **kite surf**, an amazing water-board sport.
