Hi, I am Marco from Italy.  

I am a machine learning engineer and data scientist with broad knowledge in time 
series analysis, forecasting, anomaly detection, and econometrics.  
I specialized in developing and enhancing business forecasting processes and practices.   
Over the years I developed and contributed to core forecasting systems in sectors 
like e-commerce fashion, airline, tourism and travel. I also guided and mentored 
junior colleagues in developing predictive models that enable accurate forecasting.  
I am passionate about advancing the field of forecasting and fostering collaboration 
between academia and industry. I do academic work in time series forecasting, and 
I am a Member of the International Institute of Forecasters.  
I also hold multiple certifications related to the analysis and forecasting of 
time series data. Recently I have enjoyed teaching professionals and university 
students about time series analysis, machine learning, programming, and statistics.  

I speak Italian, English and a little bit of French.  

Have a look at my [Curriculum Vitae](https://marcozanotti.github.io/CVitae/cv_resume/cv_en.html)!  


## Professional Experience

I am a **Data Scientist** with **9+ years** of working experience.

I started to work as Junior Data Scientist in 2017, in an Italian
multinational tourism company, [Uvet AMEX GBT](https://www.uvetgbt.com/), 
and its airline company [Blue Panorama](https://www.blue-panorama.com/it). 
There, I learnt a ton of things related to **programming in production** and I 
had the opportunity to work with lot of different data related to business travel, 
pharmaceutical events, online bookings, hotels' reservations, and proprietary 
airline data.

In 2020, I started to work as a Data Scientist for T-Voice, a start-up
company of the [Triboo Group](https://triboo.com/), where I
worked as a Senior Consultant to develop **client specific data analysis solutions**, 
and I was responsible for the coordination of the R&D team.

In 2021, following an M&A operation, I became a Data Scientist in 
[Blogmeter](https://www.blogmeter.it/it/home), a company of the 
[Shibumi Group](https://shibumi.group/), where I helped to integrate machine 
learning solutions into the main applications of the company and coordinated the 
Product team.

In 2024 I moved to [Wanan Luxury](https://www.wananluxury.com/), an e-commerce
fashion company, where I lead the time series forecasting area.

Throughout all my working experience I was responsible for the
development of **time series forecasting** models, both for internal and
clients needs.  
I developed and maintained diverse statistical and machine learning models to 
predict future sales at different aggregations to support strategic decisions, 
daily inbound calls to optimize scheduling hours, air passenger demand over 
several destinations to support aircraft planning, business car rental demand to 
support fleets management, etc.  
I coordinated and contributed to the development of a forecasting tool to predict 
future demand for tens of thousands item-level (SKUs) time series across several 
markets worldwide, and with different product hierarchies.  
I helped to integrate probabilistic methods to support more informed decisions.  
Moreover, I successfully improved the approach to forecasting, resulting in a 
significant reduction of errors and facilitating the faster adoption of machine 
learning solutions by the business.  
Finally, I provided mentorship to junior colleagues, supporting their professional 
growth and development in the field of forecasting.  

Since 2022 I am also a **Ph.D. Researcher in Statistics** at the University
of Milano Bicocca, where I am working on academic research projects related to
time series forecasting.


## Teaching Experience

Since 2019 I am **Adjunct Professor** at the University of Milan. 
I teach Statistics and Mathematical Methods in few Bachelor's degree 
courses, and Time Series Forecasting, Statistical Learning and Coding
at the Master's degree in [Data Science](https://dse.cdl.unimi.it/en).  
Have a look at my [teachings](https://marcozanotti.netlify.app/teachings/).  

I also I offer **consultancy and training** about forecasting, machine learning, 
and the development of business specific statistical models. 
I helped several companies, like Luxottica, Mediaworld, and Blue Panorama Airlines, 
to improve their forecasting processes and tools.

I like teaching, indeed, since 2018 I have helped **more than 300
students** with their exams, thesis and PhD projects, through **private
lectures** and support. I mainly teach econometrics, time series,
forecasting, programming, statistics and data science related topics.  
I am a top teacher on [Superprof](https://www.superprof.it/) Italia
for 
[**Econometrics & Forecasting**](https://www.superprof.it/lezioni-econometria-time-series-forecasting-stata-gretl-anche-inglese-docente-universitario-phd.html), and
[**Statistics**](https://www.superprof.it/lezioni-statistica-anche-inglese-docente-universitario-phd-statistica-data-scientist.html), and 
[**Artificial Intelligence**](https://www.superprof.it/lezioni-machine-learning-deep-learning-python-anche-inglese-docente-universitario-phd-statistica.html).


## Publications

In 2021 I published an R package related to the topic of **behavioral finance**
It is the first R package allowing R users to perform several types of
behavioral analysis.  
The released version of the [**dispositionEffect**](https://marcozanotti.github.io/dispositionEffect)
package is available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dispositionEffect).  
The software has been presented at the [useR!2021 Conference](https://user2021.r-project.org/) 
and it has been listed on the [Top 40 New CRAN Packaes](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2021/09/27/august-2021-top-40-new-cran-packages/)
on August 2021.

Since 2022 I am working academic research projects related to **time series forecasting**.
In particular, I am going to publish few papers that focus on sustainable forecasting 
practices and the development of a high-performance forecasting system.

- Zanotti, 2026, On the forecast stability of global forecasting models
- Zanotti, 2026, Do global forecasting models require frequent retraining?


## Education

I studied in Italy and Finland, where I lived for six months and I had
amazing experiences.

&nbsp;

I graduated **cum laude** in a **Master's degree in Quantitative Finance** 
at the University of Milan, with a thesis related to time series forecasting.

In 2018, while working, I got a second level **Master in Data Science**.

Since 2022, I am a **Ph.D. Researcher of Statistics** at the University of Milano 
Bicocca. My research topics are time series forecasting, cross-learning, 
forecasting stability, time series foundation models (LLMs), and sustainable AI.

I always try to keep my knowledge improving, indeed, during the last five years 
I got many certifications related to data science and forecasting.


## Sports & Hobbies

I was a **footballer**. I played in Italian minor championships until
22. I also like reading manga, playing board games, curling and
footgolf.

Since 2020, I practice **kite surf**, an amazing water-board sport, and 
whenever I can I go kite surfing all around the world.
