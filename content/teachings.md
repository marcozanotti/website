## Time Series Forecasting: Machine Learning and Deep Learning with R & Python

2021-2022  

[MSc Data Science for Economics, University of Milan](https://dse.cdl.unimi.it/en)   

*Overview*
  
In the last 15 years, business requests related to time series forecasting changed 
dramatically. Business needs evolved from predicting at most 100, low frequency 
data, to forecasting 10.000, high frequency time series. Unfortunately, the 
classical tools may not be the best anymore, both in terms of accuracy and computationally.
Hence, nowadays the “time series forecasting” data scientist is required 
to be capable of providing business forecasting solutions tackling both scalability 
and accuracy, constantly keeping up-to-date with new methods.

The aim of the course is to teach how time series forecasting problems can be solved 
in practice. The state-of-the-art techniques are presented from a very practical 
point of view, throughout **R** tutorials. **Python** algorithms are also presented 
and used within R by means of the reticulate package.

## Machine Learning, Statistical Learning & Artificial Intelligence

[MSc Data Science for Economics, University of Milan](https://dse.cdl.unimi.it/en)   

*Overview*
  
Statistical Learning 
is part of the [Machine Learning, Statistical Learning, Deep Learning & Artificial Intelligence](https://www.unimi.it/en/education/degree-programme-courses/2022/machine-learning-statistical-learning-deep-learning-and-artificial-intelligence)
course.  
The course introduces students to the most important algorithmical and 
statistical machine learning tools. The first part of the course focuses 
on the statistical foundations and on the methodological aspects. 
The second part is more hands-on, with laboratories to help students 
develop their software skills.

The **Statistical Learning** part of the course aims at teaching a
methodological and practical overview to statistical learning methods. 
The emphasis is on the applications and state-of-the-art techniques 
are presented through hands-on labs with **R**.

## R Coding

2021-2022

[MSc Data Science for Economics, University of Milan](https://dse.cdl.unimi.it/en)

*Overview*

R Coding is part of the [Coding for Data
Science](https://www.unimi.it/it/corsi/insegnamenti-dei-corsi-di-laurea/2022/coding-data-science-and-data-management)
course.  
The course aims at providing technical skills about coding/scripting
aspects for data analysis and to manage persistent data storage of
sources and results involved in analysis. On the one side, the Python
programming language and the R framework are illustrated. The goal is to
deal with essential notions about data structures and control structures
of both Python and R. On the other side, the goal is to present the core
notions of relational databases, such as keys, integrity, and
primary/foreign key constraints, as well as the SQL language for data
definition, manipulation, and query. Recent and innovative NoSQL
solutions are also discussed, with special focus on a document-oriented
system called MongoDB.

The **R Coding** part of the course aims at teaching **R Programming**,
focusing on how to code with modern and state-of-the-art R packages.

## R for Business

I train professionals (both business and academics) on the use of R, from the 
very basic to advanced level.  

Especially, I offer consultancy on **R in production**, relative to the best 
practices of software development using R (Code versioning, CI/CD, testing and 
documenting). 
The highly intensive training allows companies to help their specialists in 
the process of becoming **R Developers, not just simple R users**.

## Private Lectures

I teach econometrics, time series, forecasting, R programming, statistics and 
data science related topics to students and business professionals.  
I have help more than 100 students preparing their exams, thesis and PhD projects.
