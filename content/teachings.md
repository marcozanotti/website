## Time Series Forecasting: Machine Learning and Deep Learning with R & Python

*Overview*
  
In the last 15 years, business requests related to time series forecasting changed 
dramatically. Business needs evolved from predicting at most 100, low frequency 
data, to forecasting 10.000, high frequency time series. Unfortunately, the 
classical tools may not be the best anymore, both in terms of accuracy and computationally.
Hence, nowadays the “time series forecasting” data scientist is required 
to be capable of providing business forecasting solutions tackling both scalability 
and accuracy, constantly keeping up-to-date with new methods.

The aim of the course is to teach how time series forecasting problems can be solved 
in practice. The state-of-the-art techniques are presented from a very practical 
point of view, throughout **R** and **Python** tutorials.

## Statistical Learning, Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence

*Overview*
  
The course introduces the most important algorithmic and statistic machine 
learning tools. It aims at teaching a methodological and practical overview to 
statistical learning methods. The emphasis is on the applications and 
state-of-the-art techniques are presented through hands-on labs with **R**.

## R Coding

*Overview*

The course aims at providing technical skills about coding/scripting
aspects for data analysis and to manage persistent data storage of
sources and results involved in analysis. On the one side, the R framework is 
illustrated. The goal is to deal first with essential notions about data 
structures and control structures of R, then to learn how to code with modern 
and state-of-the-art R packages.

## Business Consulting

I offer **consultancy and training** about forecasting, machine learning, 
and the development of business specific statistical models. 

I helped several companies, like Luxottica, Mediaworld, and Blue Panorama Airlines, 
to improve their forecasting processes and tools.
I also helped companies to train their employees on how to use R and Python for
data analysis and forecasting.
The highly intensive training allows companies to help their specialists in the 
process of becoming proficient forecasters and forecasting model developers.

## Private Lectures

I teach econometrics, time series, forecasting, R programming, statistics and 
data science related topics to students.  
I have helped more than 300 students preparing their exams, thesis and projects.
