## Time Series Forecasting: Machine Learning and Deep Learning with R & Python

2021-2022  

MSc [Data Science for Economics](https://www.unimi.it/it/corsi/corsi-di-laurea/data-science-and-economics-dse),
University of Milan  

*Overview*
  
In the last 15 years, business requests related to time series forecasting changed 
dramatically. Business needs evolved from predicting at most 100, low frequency 
data, to forecasting 10.000, high frequency time series. Unfortunately, the 
classical tools may not be the best anymore, both in terms of accuracy and computationally.
Hence, nowadays the “time series forecasting” data scientist is required 
to be capable of providing business forecasting solutions tackling both scalability 
and accuracy, constantly keeping up-to-date with new methods.

The aim of the course is to teach how time series forecasting problems can be solved 
in practice. The state-of-the-art techniques are presented from a very practical 
point of view, throughout **R** tutorials. **Python** algorithms are also presented 
and used within R by means of the reticulate package.

## R for Business

I train professionals (both business and academics) on the use of R, 
from the very basic to advanced level.  

Especially, I offer consultancy on **R in production**, relative to the best 
practices of software development using R (Code versioning, CI/CD, testing and 
documenting). 
The highly intensive training allows companies to help their specialists in 
the process of becoming **R Developers, not just simple R users**.

## Private Lectures

I teach econometrics, time series, forecasting, R programming, statistics and 
data science related topics to students and business professionals.  
I have help more than 100 students preparing their exams, thesis and PhD projects.
