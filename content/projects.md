## Disposition Effect

&nbsp;  

{{< image src="/img/de_250x250.png" position="center" >}}

&nbsp;  

The disposition effect is a **joint research project** on the topic of Behavioral 
Economics & Finance developed by me and 
[Lorenzo Mazzucchelli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzo-mazzucchelli-72a661122/).  

The *disposition effect* is an irrational behavior in financial markets consisting 
in the realization that investors are more likely to sell an asset when it is 
gaining value compared to when it is losing value. A phenomenon which is closely 
related to sunk costsâ€™ bias, diminishing sensitivity, and loss aversion.  

The research project aims at studying the disposition effect more deeply and
and more effectively compared to what it is already been done by other researchers.  
To do that, the project focuses on two main aspects:  

1. **Methodological advances** with the publication of 4 working papers:   
- *Mazzucchelli, 2022, Analysis of short-selling and volatility impact on disposition effect*  
- *Mazzucchelli, and Zanotti, 2022, Portfolio driven disposition effect: the wide framing approach*  
- *Mazzucchelli, and Zanotti, 2022, Mean reverting expectations to rationalize the disposition effect*  

2. **Practical advances** with the creation of a software helping researchers and 
institutions in the computation of the disposition effect: the 
**[dispositionEffect](https://marcozanotti.github.io/dispositionEffect)** R Package.

The released version of the software is available on 
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dispositionEffect).
The development version, instead, is available on 
[Github](https://github.com/marcozanotti/dispositionEffect).   

The software has been presented at the [useR!2021 Conference](https://user2021.r-project.org/),
it has been listed on the 
[Top 40 New CRAN Packaes](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2021/09/27/august-2021-top-40-new-cran-packages/)
on August 2021, and it has been accepted within the 
[R-Universe](https://marcozanotti.r-universe.dev/ui#builds).


## Time Series Forecasting Tool: Global Models

Working project related to the development of a **high-performance forecasting system** 
that allows to quickly produce forecasts for thousands time series using many different
approaches and algorithms.  
Especially, the project focuses on the use of the novel **global models methodologies**.
