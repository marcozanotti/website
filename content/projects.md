## Forecast App

The [**Forecast App**](https://marcozanotti.shinyapps.io/ForecastApp/) 
is a comprehensive tool designed to guide users 
through the entire forecasting workflow, from raw data to scenario analysis.
It is tailored for both beginners and experienced practitioners, allowing the 
exploration, modeling, and explanation of time series data without requiring 
advanced knowledge of forecasting techniques.  

The app is organized into four main sections — Data, Analyze, 
Features, and Forecast — which collectively enable users to:  

- Upload and explore time series data  
- Detect and handle missing values and anomalies  
- Transform and preprocess data for improved forecasting performance  
- Create and select relevant features, both internal and external  
- Fit and optimize a wide range of forecasting models, including classical, 
machine learning, deep learning, and ensemble approaches  
- Evaluate, compare, and explain the models’ predictions  
- Generate probabilistic forecasts and business-oriented scenarios  

The app provides great flexibility in analysis: interactive visualizations, 
configurable model parameters, and multiple options for evaluation and 
explanation allow users to tailor the process to their specific needs.

You can access the latest version at [Forecast App](https://marcozanotti.shinyapps.io/ForecastApp/). 

Follow the [user guide](https://marcozanotti.github.io/tsforecasting-dashboard/manual/forecastapp-manual.html) 
to leverage the full potential of the Forecast App to obtain accurate 
forecasts, understand model behavior, and explore different scenarios for 
informed decision-making.

## Disposition Effect

The disposition effect is a **joint research project** on the topic of Behavioral 
Economics & Finance developed by me and 
[Lorenzo Mazzucchelli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzo-mazzucchelli-72a661122/).  

The *disposition effect* is an irrational behavior in financial markets consisting 
in the realization that investors are more likely to sell an asset when it is 
gaining value compared to when it is losing value. A phenomenon which is closely 
related to sunk costs’ bias, diminishing sensitivity, and loss aversion.  

The research project aims at studying the disposition effect more deeply and
and more effectively compared to what it is already been done by other researchers.  
The project ends with the publication of a scientific paper and an open source software:     

  
- *Mazzucchelli L., and Zanotti M., (2026), Bridging the Gap: Enhancing Integrated Framing with Idiosyncratic Volatility and Short Selling*   

- [*dispositionEffect, R Software, CRAN*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dispositionEffect)  
  
The software has been presented at the [useR!2021 Conference](https://user2021.r-project.org/),
and it has been listed on the 
[Top 40 New CRAN Packaes](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2021/09/27/august-2021-top-40-new-cran-packages/)
on August 2021.


## Silene Acaulis

The Silene acaulis is a **collaboration project** on the topic of Ecological Science
developed by [Maria Elisa Pierfederici](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-elisa-pierfederici-5392aa182/). 
I have contributed to the research with the statistical analysis of biological 
data.   

Climate is an important determinant of plant population growth rates; 
however, different components of climate may have contrasting effects on 
both plant population growth rates and individual plant vital rates. Thus, 
it is necessary to evaluate multiple climatic drivers simultaneously to 
understand how climate may affect plant population survival and persistence. 
The project focused on the alpine cushion plant Silene acaulis, a 
foundational plant widely distributed in the Northern hemisphere that 
facilitates other species by creating microclimatic habitats.  

The project ends with the publication of a scientific paper:  

- *Pierfederici et al, (2026), Climate changing's effects on Silene acaulis*.
